# Valkyria Chronicles 3 Extra Edition DLC
Documentation and tools used for the DLC's translation are preserved here. 

# Goal and Intent
- A full translation of the paid DLC that isn't included in the base game of Valkyria Chronicles 3 Extra Edition.
- A translation that balances accuracy and the feeling of an official localization. Some creative liberties are fine as long as the general intent and feel are conveyed, but shouldn’t show up often.
- Names, terms, and general formatting must be consistent with the official localization of VC1, VC2, and VC4.

# About
**Currently looking for additional translators to help us speed things along!**  
Translation is being done through Google Sheets. Will make the sheets public once I get everything ready and setted up.   
If this project goes through, a re-translation/re-work of vc3translationproject's unfinished translation is considered.
