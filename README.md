## This project is abandoned. Scripts will not be translated but the patcher will be at least be finished up at least!
Another team already translated the DLC and base game here: https://github.com/akorov/VC3ReTranslation

# Valkyria Chronicles 3 Extra Edition DLC
Documentation and tools used for the DLC's translation are preserved here. 

# Goal and Intent
- Provide a full translation of the paid DLC that isn't included in the base game of Valkyria Chronicles 3 Extra Edition.
- Create a translation that balances accuracy and the feeling of an official localization. Some creative liberties are fine as long as the general intent and feel are conveyed, but they should be used sparingly.
- Ensure that names, terms, and general formatting must be consistent with the official localization of VC1, VC2, and VC4.

# About
**Currently looking for additional translators to help us speed things along!**  
Translation is being done through [Google Sheets & Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TA4iO7Ppx-SA3uX3D_t160LyyUYu7x4f?usp=drive_link)  
If this project goes through, a re-translation/re-work of vc3translationproject's unfinished translation may be considered.
