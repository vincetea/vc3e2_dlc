# PGD 
The DATA.BIN file is initially encrypted with PGD (Protected Game Data), a data format used to store game data. It can be decrypted with pgdecrypt. Once decrypted, the DATA.BIN is revealed to be a CPK archive file.

# CPK
Cri Ware's proprietary archive file. Files can be extracted from the CPK archive using quickbms with a CPK script. 

# Extracted Files
Once the CPK archive file is extracted, there are many different type of propietary files. These proprietary files types are used in Valkyria Chronicles, Valkyria Chronicles 2, Valkyria Chronicles 3, and Shining Blade. Games on the PSP that uses these types of files are very
similar. Shining Blade actually contains left over text files from Valkyria Chronicles 3.
